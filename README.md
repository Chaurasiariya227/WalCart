🛒 Smart Inventory Recommender
An AI-powered system to forecast product demand and recommend restocking quantities using sequential modeling, built for smarter retail inventory management.

🚀 Overview
Retailers often face challenges with overstocking, stockouts, and manual inventory planning. This project uses Transformer-based models to predict demand for each SKU based on past sales trends and recommend optimal inventory levels.

The project features a simple frontend dashboard to visualize:

Forecasted product demand

Reorder recommendations

Alerts for stockouts and overstock risk

🧠 Problem Statement
Traditional inventory systems overlook sequential purchase behavior, seasonality, and external events. This leads to inefficient stock planning.
This project solves that by using a Smart Recommender System for inventory managers, predicting what to stock, how much, and when — using advanced deep learning models.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend:

HTML / CSS / JavaScript (or React)
